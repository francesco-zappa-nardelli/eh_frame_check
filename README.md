eh_frame_check.py

`eh_frame_check.py` is a simple tool that attempts to _validate_ the
eh_frame tables.  It is limited to return addresses for now.  It step
through the program with gdb, checks the call and ret instructions to
build a concrete view of the stack frames, evaluate the `.eh_frame` infos
with the current register values, and compares them.  Mismatches are
reported.

Setup
-----

`eh_frame_check.py` relies on gdb with the python 2.7 or 3 interpreter
compiled in.  To check:

```
$ gdb
(gdb) python print (sys.version)
````

In case, the magic incantation to recompile gdb is:

- download gdb from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb (tested with GNU gdb (GDB) 7.11)
- ./configure --prefix /usr/local/gdb-python2 --with-python
- make; make install

Invocation
----------

```
$ gdb -q -x eh_frame_check.py <path_to_binary>
```

At the beginning of the script the options `verbose` and `dbg_eval`
can be set to true to obtain respectively a trace of the analysed
instructions and of the dwarf expression evaluator.  

A sample trace with `verbose` enabled:

```
$ gdb -q -x eh_frame_check.py ~/tmp/foo3

The INIT/CALL/RET tags show the expected locations of the return
addresses on the stack after each call/ret instruction.  The =>
preceedes the address of each instruction being executed/analysed.
The error message lists the return address computed from the eh_frame
tabels and the expected one, together with the IP at which the
mismatch is detected.

Notes
-----

The concrete view of the stack frame is built by:

- intercept CALL: a return address is pushed on the stack
- intercept RET: a return address is popped by the stack

Attic
-----

- intercept PUSH imm(%rip), as in (from objdump -d /bin/true):

Disassembly of section .plt:
